ETS tables are particularly useful for data that
■ Doesn’t need to be shared between virtual machines
■ Needs to be persistent, but only as long as the VM is alive
■ May need to be shared by a number of different processes on the VM
■ Needs fast access times
■ Is mainly flat and preferably without foreign key relationships to other tables
