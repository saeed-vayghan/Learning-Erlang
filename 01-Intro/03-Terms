** In Erlang, all variables must start with a capital letter, so you can write A = 3. but not a = 3.
** Erlang only lets you assign a variable once in a function. (single assignment).
** Pattern matching is used for assigning values to variables and for controlling the flow of a program.

** The special variable underscore (written ‘_’) is the anonymous or don’t care variable.
It is used as a place holder where the syntax requires a variable, but the value of the variable is of no interest.

** A variable whose value has been assigned is said to be bound otherwise it is said to be unbound.
** Bounded variables are called bind once or single assignment.

** Pattern matching occurs:
  • when evaluating an expression of the form Lhs = Rhs
  • when calling a function
  • when matching a pattern in a case or receive primitive.
