There are two ways to build this code.  The first is to cd into each of the application directories in the lib directory and run the following command:

erlc -o ./ebin -I ./include ./src/*.erl

The second way to build this code is to install the Sinan build system. To install it go to Erlware.org and download the Faxien package management system.  Once installed run 

<erlware-install-dir>/bin/faxien install-release sinan

When that is finished just type sinan. This will build all the applications correctly and place them at _build/development/apps/<appname>-<appvsn>. More on Sinan and Faxien can be found in appendix C of this book.
